Prequired packages (names are varying between Linux distributions): cmake, go, libsystemd-dev, lighttpd

Build instructions:

- Clone beta-software repo
- cd into cloned repo
- cd axiom_beta_control_daemon
- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake ..
- make -j4

Setup daemon:
- cd into systemd directory
- copy .socket and .service to /etc/systemd/system
- Adjust the path to axiom_daemon executable in .service (This step will be adjusted later, so daemon is installed to some global place)

- systemctl start axiom
- systemctl status axiom to check if the service was started correctly, last line should say "legacy socket initialization" (preliminary log for now, will be improved later)

Setup web GUI:
- Copy TestGUI folder to /srv/http (ArchLinux) or /var/www/html (Debian-based distributions)
- Modify server address in main.js in method sendSettings()
