## Download Nightly Firmware
If you want to experiment with the latest changes and dont mind, when the camera isnt working, you try use the untested nightly firmware images.
```diff
- Warning! The nightly images are not veryfied by a human and might damage your camera permanently. 
- Only continue, if you know, what you are doing!
```

To try this anyway, you
1. Have to [download etcher](https://etcher.io/) & install it
2. go to the [github releases page](https://github.com/apertus-open-source-cinema/axiom-beta-firmware/releases) and dowload the latest image (it might not be the first in the list).
2. Select the `axiom-beta-***.img.xz` file of the image in etcher and flash it on a microsd card with at least 8GB.
